# Autonomous-Paper-Ball-Catcher
This project aims to build an autonomous mobile robot that catches a thrown paper ball using multiple stationary cameras for perception and localization. Unlike typical on-robot vision systems, this setup places RGB cameras in the environment, allowing distributed tracking of both the robot (dustbin) and the paper ball in a shared world frame.
